  \brief Allows to detect UPnP devices in the network.

  \ingroup hardware
  \inmodule libnymea

  This resource allows plugins to discover UPnP devices in the network and receive notification messages. The resource
  will bind a UDP socket to the multicast 239.255.255.250 on port 1900.

  The communication was implementet using following documentation: \l{http://upnp.org/specs/arch/UPnP-arch-DeviceArchitecture-v1.1.pdf}
